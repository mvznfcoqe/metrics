# Project Rules

## Code Style

- NEVER add comments to code
- Code should be self-documenting through clear variable names, function names, and structure
- Do not add docstrings, inline comments, or explanatory comments to any code files
- Only exception: retain existing comments if they already exist in the codebase, but do not add new ones
